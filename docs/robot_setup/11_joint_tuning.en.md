# Tuning Joint Drive Gains

## Learning Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will have learned:

- How to use the Gain Tuner extension
- How to tune position drive gains
- How to tune velocity drive gains
- How to configure velocity limits for industrial robots
- How to save gains to the asset
- How to visualize results

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Complete [Tutorial 7: Configure a Manipulator](07_configure_manipulator.md) before starting this tutorial.

### Estimated Time

Approximately 15-20 minutes.

### Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Gain Tuner extension to optimize joint drive parameters on robots. You will master techniques for balancing stability and responsiveness through systematic tuning of position and velocity-driven joints.

## Gain Tuning

### Position Drive

Tune gains for position (pose) control.

### Velocity Limit and Industrial Robots

Learn how to configure velocity limits for industrial robots.

### Velocity Drive

Tune gains for velocity control.

## Saving Gains to the Asset

Save the tuned gains to the robot asset.

## Visualizing Results

Visualize tuning results with plots.
