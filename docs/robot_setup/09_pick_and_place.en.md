# Pick and Place Example

## Learning Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will have learned:

- How to control a gripper
- How to use Lula Kinematics Solver for target following
- How to configure RMPFlow motion control
- How to implement a pick and place task

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Complete [Tutorial 8: Generate Robot Configuration File](08_generate_robot_config.md) before starting this tutorial.

### Estimated Time

Approximately 20-30 minutes.

### Overview

In this tutorial, you will perform pick and place tasks using the UR10e robot and 2F-140 gripper. You will combine target following with the Lula Kinematics Solver and motion control with RMPFlow to manipulate objects.

## Gripper Control Example

Learn the basics of controlling gripper open/close operations.
