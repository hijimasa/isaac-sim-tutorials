# ShapeNet Importer

!!! warning "Deprecated"
    The `omni.isaac.shapenet` extension is no longer maintained. To import ShapeNet models, use the standard OBJ file import procedure instead.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will have learned:

- An overview of 3D models from the ShapeNet database
- How to import ShapeNet models as OBJ files

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with basic Isaac Sim operations.
- Basic knowledge of 3D model formats (OBJ files).

### Overview

This tutorial covers how to import 3D models from the ShapeNet database into Isaac Sim. Since the dedicated extension is deprecated, the standard OBJ import procedure is used instead.

## Recommended Alternative

Since the dedicated ShapeNet importer extension is deprecated, follow these steps:

1. Download models from ShapeNet in OBJ format
2. Import them as standard OBJ files in Isaac Sim (**File > Import**)
3. Adjust scale, materials, and physics properties as needed

## Summary

This tutorial covered the following topics:

1. Overview of the **ShapeNet** database
2. **OBJ import** as an alternative procedure
